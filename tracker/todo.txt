Things I need to work on for the Tracker project.


1) Somehow I need to make the computer work with no data IN WINDOWS
	A) You would have to figure out how to use powershell from python.
	B) Then you would have to figure out the commands that are equivalent to Linux.
2) Put all the individual graphs into one dashboard. 

3) Add the option to remove an entry

4) Fix the flow os the y/n questions. Make them to where any key gets you yes, but "n" gets you no.
	I like pressing enter.
