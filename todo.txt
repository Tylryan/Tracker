Things I need to work on for the Tracker project.

1) Somehow make the program work even if the user has no data.
	a) It would need to make it's own file: records and backup.
	b) It would need to be able to give them column names: Subject, Date, Hour
	c) It would need to be able to populate those empty columns.
2) Put all the individual graphs into one dashboard.
